        <p>Chicken soup is a soup made from chicken, simmered in water, usually with various other ingredients. The classic chicken soup consists of a clear chicken broth, often with pieces of chicken or vegetables; common additions are pasta, noodles, dumplings, or grains such as rice and barley. Chicken soup has acquired the reputation of a folk remedy for colds and influenza.</p>
        <p>Variations on the flavor are gained by adding root vegetables such as parsnip, potato, sweet potato and celery root; herbs such as parsley and dill; other vegetables such as zucchini, whole garlic cloves, lettuce, or tomatoes; and black pepper. The soup should be brought slowly to a boil and then simmered in a covered pot on a very low flame for one to three hours, adding water if necessary. Saffron or turmeric are sometimes added as a yellow colorant.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 whole chicken</li>
            <li>4 carrots, halved</li>
            <li>4 stalks celery, halved</li>
            <li>1 large onion, halved</li>
            <li>water</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the raw chicken thighs to a large stockpot, cover with cold water, and bring to a boil. Reduce to medium-low heat and simmer until the chicken is fully cooked. If youâ€™re short on time, skip this step and use your favorite store-bought chicken stock and add shredded rotisserie chicken.</li>
            <li>While you wait for your chicken to finish cooking, cook the vegetables in a separate pot or Dutch oven set over medium heat. Cook the vegetables for 10-15 minutes or until they start to soften. Toward the end, add the salt, black pepper, bay leaves, and garlic (if using).</li>
            <li>Once the chicken is fully cooked, carefully remove the chicken from the pot and strain the broth through a fine-mesh strainer into the same pot containing the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Shred the chicken once it is cool enough to handle. Do not return the chicken to the pot.</li>
            <li>Simmer for 30 minutes, or until the vegetables are fully cooked and tender. In the last 10 minutes, add the shredded chicken and lemon juice and season to taste.</li>
        </ol>
