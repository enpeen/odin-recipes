    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sacher torte is a chocolate cake of Austrian origin, inventer by Franz Sacher, supposedly in 1832 for Prince Metternich in Vienna. It is one of the most famous Viennese culinary specialities. According to Franz Sachers son Eduard, Sacher torte was invented by Franz, when he was an apprentice under Chancellor Metternichs chef. The story goes that Franz was required to create a novel cake when the chef was ill. The Metternich connection was probably invented by Eduard many years later, to appeal to "Viennese nostalgic for their imperial past" </p>
    <p>The "Original" Sacher Torte has two layers of apricot jam between the outer layer of chocolate icing and the sponge base, while Demels "Eduard-Sacher-Torte! has only one. Demels cake is denser and smoother. Some of the various recipes for cakes similar to the "Original" are listed below. For example, at "Graz-Kulturhauptstadt 2003", a festival marking the city of Graz being declared cultural capital that year, "Sacher-Masoch-Torte" was presented (its name alluding to Leopold von Sacher-Masoch), using redcurrant jam and marzipan. </p>
