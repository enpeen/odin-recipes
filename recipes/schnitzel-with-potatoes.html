        <img src="../images/schnitzel-with-potatoes.jpg" width="400" alt="Schnitzel with potatoes">
        <p>A schnitzel is a thin slice of meat. The meat is usually thinned by pounding with a meat tenderizer. Most commonly, the meat is breaded before frying. Breaded schnitzel is popular in many countries and is made using veal, pork, chicken, mutton, beef, or turkey. Schnitzel is very similar to the dish escalope in France and Spain, tonkatsu in Japan, cotoletta in Italy, kotlet schabowy in Poland, milanesa in Argentina, chuleta valluna in Colombia, and chicken-fried steak and pork tenderloin of the United States. </p>
